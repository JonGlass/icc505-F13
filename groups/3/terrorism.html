			<h1>Interpretation of "Terrorism"</h1>

			<div class="card" id="french"><img src="images/french.jpg"></div>

			<div class="pop_up" id="french_pop_up"><p>The word “terrorism” was first popularized during the French Revolution in the late 1700s, and the term carried a positive connotation because it was a means for establishing order during periods of chaos. It was also associated with democracy. By the 1930s, the meaning was used to describe dictators and totalitarian states such as Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and Stalinist Russia. After the World War II, terrorism once again meant a violent revolt and had the revolutionary connotations with which it is usually associated today.<br><br>
			Although Libya formally accepted responsibility (but did not admit guilt) for the bombing of Pan Am 103 in 2003, the true motives for the act of terrorism remain unclear. However, it was clear that the bombing was an act of state-sponsored terrorism. During the 1980s, state sponsored terrorism was eight times more lethal than acts carried out without state assistance.</p></div>

			<div class="pop_up" id="twin_towers_pop_up">Terrorism has evolved from hundreds of smaller attacks to fewer, but more destructive incidents in the past few decades. From 1980-1990, the time period of Pan Am 103, 2,718 people were killed in terrorist incidents. From 2000-2006, 16,223 fatalities occurred. One of the reasons for this is that terrorists are trying to create a message in today’s global society. When looking at the events of September 11, 2001, Joan Deppa, Syracuse University professor says, “It’s not an accident. It’s an act of mass communication.” The events of 9/11 were timed to coincide with the morning news broadcasts, which was the primary way people received their information at that time. They also timed the attacks so all the television cameras would be pointed at the first tower when the second plane hit the second tower. Deppa says that part of the reason that everyone is more likely to label events as terrorism early on is because the terrorists themselves want them to. They are staging events for coverage in order to make the largest impact and advocate their root cause. Many people are also attributing the trend to the rise in religiously motivated terrorism as opposed to state sponsored terrorism of Pan Am 103.</div>

			<div class="pop_up" id="shoe_pop_up"><p>Another change is that terrorists went from having some concern for women and children to indiscriminately claiming the lives of anyone in their path. For example, in 1905, an organization was attempting to assassinate Grand Duke Serge Alexandrovich. When the royal carriage came into view, the shooter saw that the duke was unexpectedly accompanied by children and aborted the mission rather than harm the family. By comparison, the Lockerbie bombing took the lives of all 259 victims—men, women, and children—and any inhabitants of the village that happened to be hit by the falling plane.<br><br>
			Terrorists have also tried to plan events to occur on American soil so that the incident cannot be ignored. The Pan Am 103 flight exploded Scotland, but since then there have been several terrorist attacks in United States territory, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, the attempted Times Square car bombing, and the Boston Marathon bombing.</p></div>
