			<div class="pop_up" id="family_pop_up"><p>Pan Am 103 was a milestone in terrorism, but it didn’t quite have the impact that 9/11 did. In our poll, we asked, “Has your life changed since 9/11?”<br><br>

			Laws and regulations (especially pertaining to security measures) are much more strict. Personal freedoms are being infringed upon for the sake of "national security."<br><br>
			I am brown and although I am of Latina descent I have been racially profiled. I have many friends who have also been racially profiled. I feel that fear is instilled more on the news than ever before.<br><br>
			There is an underlying stress constantly at airports, public spaces, and other places that have intense security.<br><br>
			I was young when September 11th happened. I didn't really understand terrorism. It forced us at a young age to understand it and extremely fear it. It made it very real and hit very close to home. We live in constant fear since that day.<br><br>
			Since it's such a significant moment in recent history, I notice that when people are looking back on an event or measuring time from that year, they will always mention it somehow. For example, "I must have been 15 when that happened because I remember it was about 3 months after 9/11." I also notice that foreigners mention it a lot and associate it with the United States in a significant way.</p></div>
