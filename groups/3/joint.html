			<h1>Joint Investigations</h1>

			<div class="note" id="before_pan_am"><p>In 1984 and 1986, Congress passed laws allowing the US to investigate terrorist activities overseas. Along with this type of authority came the need for joint investigations between countries. There have been hundreds of terrorist attacks across the world, but very few of them are actually state sponsored.</p>

			<div class="note" id="map_caption">There were 19 countries involved because there were victims from 19 different countries on the plane.</div>

			<div class="pop_up" id="map_pop_up"><p>Just because the majority of passengers on the plane were from the US did not mean that the US got to be in charge of the investigation. Pan Am 103 was the first multinational investigation and the FBI's largest investigation ever. The "main players" in the investigation were the US, Scotland, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Malta, and England. Police from both Italy and France had minor involvement as well. Because the plane landed in Lockerbie, a small police department, Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary, led the investigation despite the presence of much larger top-agencies from around the world.</p></div>



			<div class="card" id="quote">"Everyone likes to be in charge of their own case... Knowledge is power."<br>~Richard Marquis, Head of the FBI's investigation</div>
			<div class="pop_up" id="quote_pop_up"><p>This was the first joint investigations of this sort. There was a long learning process and a lot of building trust that had to take place between the countries.</br>
			"Cooperation from the various law enforcement agencies started slow, but it really ended on a high note. There are still very strong bonds between us and the Scottish Police." ~Frank Duggan</br>
			"We didn't really quite grasp the concept of teamwork. It took a while to do that. You had to develop trust. It took a lot of interpersonal skills on the part of everyone on the investigation." ~Richard Marquise</p></div>



			<div class="card" id="benefits">By working together, the countries were each able to bring something different to the table, helping to provide a more thorough investigation.</div>

			<div class="pop_up" id="benefits_pop_up"><p>The Scottish Police did all the searching and most of the forensics.<br><br>
			Germans were very capable and helpful but “they didn’t have the opportunity to do some of the same things that we did.”<br><br>
			Many of the countries were most helpful by assisting to eliminate other suspects.<br><br>
			The FBI had a lot of experience investigating domestic terrorism before 103 because there had been a few sporadic attacks. None of the attacks had taken place on a plane before.<br><br>
			“If you look at every single event that has occurred globally where there was an American involved with it, the FBI has at least offered -- and is for the most part accepted -- to come and help investigate.”<br><br>
			The UK was more familiar with these types of investigations, given that they had to deal with the IRA – Richard Marquise</p></div>



			<div class="card" id="sharing">"Everybody was thrilled about the sharing of information during the Lockerbie case." ~Richard Marquise</div>

			<div class="pop_up" id="sharing_pop_up"><p>Early in the investigation, they decided to bring every relevant officer into a meeting and brief them on “literally everything” that related to the case. “In terms of sharing classified information, those rules have never changed.” As an FBI agent, you can’t just give away info. But they have started some Joint Terrorism Task Forces in various large cities that provide clearances to relevant information for local police officers. This is beneficial to the FBI because the local police obviously know the city and community better than a federal police would. – Richard Marquise<br><br>
			"Everybody was thrilled about the sharing of information during the Lockerbie case." In fact, the British Intelligence Agency just traveled around the world talking about the Lockerbie model of bringing agencies together. – Richard Marquise</p></div>



			<div class="card" id="changes">There have been several lessons learned and relationships formed as a result of the joint investigation.</div>

			<div class="pop_up" id="changes_pop_up"><p>Members of the Scottish police actually come to the US for memorial services sometimes. – Frank Duggan<br><br>
			The idea of reporting suspicious activity is more pervasive. “If you see something, say something.” People are more alert now, although there are still grounds to improve. – Richard Marquise<br><br>
			“Yes, we learned an important lesson from Lockerbie, but I don’t think it was institutionalized. 9/11 happened and I think it got a lot better. I think everybody looks and says ‘We never want something like that to happen again.’ Lockerbie was looked at as an isolated incident. All of the sudden 9/11 happens and that becomes such a big deal. And I’ve often said if we don’t learn the lesson of 9/11, we’re doomed to repeat them. Law enforcement, particularly in the US, and around the world has gotten much better in terms of collaborating and the mechanisms to share information in real time.” – Richard Marquise</p></div>

			<div class="note" id="jttf_caption">Joint Terrorism task forces are a collaboration of agencies within the US who work to investigate and fight terrorism.</div>

			<div class="pop_up" id="jttf_pop_up"><p>"They are our nation’s front line on terrorism: small cells of highly trained, locally based, passionately committed investigators, analysts, linguists, SWAT experts, and other specialists from dozens of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies.<br><br>
			When it comes to investigating terrorism, they do it all: chase down leads, gather evidence, make arrests, provide security for special events, conduct training, collect and share intelligence, and respond to threats and incidents at a moment’s notice.<br><br>
			The very first Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) in the nation was established April of 1980 in New York City.<br><br>
			By the mid-1980s, the JTTF began expanding to three squads and an intelligence arm was added. Investigators from several other federal, state, and local agencies joined the FBI and NYPD on the task force as it was enlarged.<br><br>
			The task forces are based in 103 cities nationwide, including at least one in each of our 56 field offices. A total of 71 of these JTTFs have been created since 9/11.<br><br>
			Today, the JTTFs include more than 4,200 members nationwide — more than four times the pre-9/11 total — hailing from over 600 state and local agencies and 50 federal agencies (the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. military, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration, to name a few).<br><br>
			They provide one-stop shopping for information regarding terrorist activities. They enable a shared intelligence base across many agencies. They create familiarity among investigators and managers before a crisis. And perhaps most importantly, they pool talents, skills, and knowledge from across the law enforcement and intelligence communities into a single team that responds together.<br><br>
			The task forces coordinate their efforts largely through the interagency National Joint Terrorism Task Force, working out of FBI Headquarters, which makes sure that information and intelligence flows freely among the local JTTFs and beyond.<br><br>
			And here’s the final—and most important—thing you should know about these JTTFs: They are working 24/7/365 to protect you, your families, and your communities from terrorist attack.” – FBI Website</br></div>
