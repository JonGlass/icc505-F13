					<p>In the months after the Pan Am bombing, the U.S. secretary of transportation met with families of Pan Am 103 victims, the president, and congressional members among others to conduct a thorough internal review of the nation's aviation security system. On April 3, 1989, several new security initiatives were announced:</p>
				<UL>
					<LI> Establish FAA security specialists overseas</LI>
					<LI> Raise standards for X-ray and metal detection equipment</LI>
					<LI> Ensure U.S. air carrier compliance with security requirements</LI>
					<LI> Create an Aviation Security Advisory Committee</LI>
					<LI> Improve the FAA security notification process</LI>
				</UL>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p>The FAA has worked with airlines on the installment of significant new security equipment. In the decade after the Pan Am bombing, the agency purchased nearly 100 certified explosives detection systems and more than 300 trace explosives detection devices.</p>
					<p>Airlines, with the support of the FAA, have implemented Computer-Assisted Passenger Screening (CAPS) systems, which have reduced passenger inconvenience while still protecting their civil liberties. The new systems also save time and money.

					<p>All 38 actions have been implemented by the FAA. Some of the major changes include:</p>
					<UL>
					<LI> Improving the flow of intelligence information into the FAA and strengthening communication with other agencies</LI>
					<LI> Posting federal security managers at the biggest and busiest airports in the United States and civil aviation security liaison officers at 20 airports overseas</LI>
					<LI> Implementing new employment and training standards for security personnel such as screeners at domestic airports; requiring criminal history record checks in some cases</LI>
					<LI> Creating guidelines to help airports build security into new airport construction</LI>
					<LI> Conducting joint FAA/FBI vulnerability assessments at major airports in the United States</LI>

					<p>One amendment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) made it possible for American victims of terrorist attacks to sue the country behind the act.</p>
					<p>Only countries on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism could be excluded from the FSIA under the new amendment. Libya, along with Iraq and North Korea, were on the list at that time.</p>
					<p>The countries on this list faced sanctions such as restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance, bans on defense exports and sales, controls over exports of dual use items and some financial restrictions.</p>
					<p>Libya was put on the list when it was created in 1979. The country eventually claimed responsibility for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and agreed to compensate families of the victims and to cooperate in the investigation and trial. After Libya agreed to cooperate with the United States' anti-terrorism efforts and to abandon its WMD program, they were removed from the list on May 15, 2006.</p>

					<p>The initial report, presented in September 1996, contained 20 recommendations for improving aviation security. Nearly all initial recommendations were implemented by the FAA before the final report was released on Feb. 12, 1997.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p>In October 1996, Congress, at the request of President Clinton and based on the Commission's recommendation, appropriated more than $400 million for new explosives detection technology and other advanced security features.</p>
					<p>"Since 1992, 60 new airlines have started service, opening up new markets, attracting new passengers, and impacting the economics of the industry significantly. The number of passengers flying in the U.S. over the last decade has grown to more than half a billion. ... The FAA projects that, in 2007, more than 800 million passengers will fly in the U.S. &mdash; 3 times the number who flew in 1980."  &mdash; Excerpt from the final report to President Clinton, White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security: Feb. 12, 1997</p>
					<p>The commission's final report listed an additional 37 recommendations for improving aviation safety and security, efficiency of air traffic control and response to aviation disasters.</p>
