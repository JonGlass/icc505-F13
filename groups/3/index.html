					<h2>"Terrorism" as a Term</h2>
					<div class="text">
						<p>The word "terrorism" was first popularized during the French Revolution in the late 1700s, and the term carried a positive connotation because it was a means for establishing order during periods of chaos. It was also associated with democracy. The original French Revolution terrorism has 2 similarities with today's terrorism: It is not random, but deliberate, organized and thought out, and its goal and justification is the creation of a new and better society. By the 1930s, the meaning was used to describe dictators and totalitarian states such as Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and Stalinist Russia. After the World War II, terrorism once again meant a violent revolt and had the revolutionary connotations with which it is usually associated today.</p>
						<p>Although Libya formally accepted responsibility (but did not admit guilt) for the bombing of Pan Am 103 in 2003, the true motives for the act of terrorism remain unclear. However, it was clear that the bombing was an act of state-sponsored terrorism. During the 1980s, state sponsored terrorism was eight times more lethal than acts carried out without state assistance.</p>
						<p>Terrorism has evolved from hundreds of smaller attacks to fewer, but more destructive incidents in the past few decades. From 1980-1990, the time period of Pan Am 103, 2,718 people were killed in terrorist incidents. From 2000-2006, 16,223 fatalities occurred. One of the reasons for this is that terrorists are trying to create a message in today’s global society. When looking at the events of September 11, 2001, Joan Deppa, Syracuse University professor says, “It’s not an accident. It’s an act of mass communication.” The events of 9/11 were timed to coincide with the morning news broadcasts, which was the primary way people received their information at that time. They also timed the attacks so all the television cameras would be pointed at the first tower when the second plane hit the second tower. Deppa says that part of the reason that everyone is more likely to label events as terrorism early on is because the terrorists themselves want them to. They are staging events for coverage in order to make the largest impact and advocate their root cause. Many people are also attributing the trend to the rise in religiously motivated terrorism as opposed to state sponsored terrorism of Pan Am 103.</P>
						<p>Another change is that terrorists went from having some concern for women and children to indiscriminately claiming the lives of anyone in their path. For example, in 1905, an organization was attempting to assassinate Grand Duke Serge Alexandrovich. When the royal carriage came into view, the shooter saw that the duke was unexpectedly accompanied by children and aborted the mission rather than harm the family. By comparison, the Lockerbie bombing took the lives of all 259 victims—men, women, and children—and any inhabitants of the village that happened to be hit by the falling plane.</p>
						<p>Terrorists have also tried to plan events to occur on American soil so that the incident cannot be ignored. The Pan Am 103 flight exploded over the middle of the Atlantic Ocean in international waters, but since then there have been several terrorist attacks in United States territory, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, the attempted Times Square car bombing, and the Boston Marathon bombing.</p>
						<p>But the terrorist goal of igniting fear in the citizens of the United States has been just as successful after each attack. The year of Pan Am, 203 Americans were killed in terrorist incidents, 93 percent from the Lockerbie bombing. That same year, Americans were just as likely to be killed by a dog as by a terrorist. Yet, nearly one-third of people surveyed that year stated that they would refuse the opportunity to travel abroad because of the terrorism threat. After September 11th, many Americans refused to fly at all, domestically or internationally.</p>
						<p><b>Different U.S. definitions of terrorism:</b></p>
						<p><i>US State Department</i>: “premediated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience”<br>
						<i>FBI</i>: “unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a Government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives”<br>
						<i>US Department of Defense</i>: “ the unlawful use of- or threatened use of- force or violence against individuals or property to coerce or intimidate governments or societies, often to achieve political, religious, or ideological objectives”</i>

					<h2>Media Coverage</h2>
					<div class="text">
						<p>The Pan Am 103 media coverage faded from view fairly rapidly because of the change in leadership in the United States. The crash occurred on December 21, 1988 when President Ronald Reagan was leaving office and President George H.W. Bush was preparing for his inauguration a month later. Reagan made a brief statement:</p>

<!--SCRAPBOOK DOCUMENT INSERT: -->

						<p>“The hijacking of Pan American Airways flight 73 at Pakistan's Karachi International Airport was a cruel and sinister terrorist act. Our hearts are filled with sympathy for the families of those innocents killed and injured. The Government of Pakistan acted boldly and decisively to bring this nightmare to an end, and we applaud Pakistan's exemplary resolve in the handling of this incident. Pan American Airways should also be commended for their cool and professional competence in helping to ensure that this incident could be concluded where it started.</p>
						<p>The terrorists conducted a despicable and cowardly crime by threatening, assaulting, and murdering innocent passengers of a crowded airliner—men and women, young and old—with machine guns and hand grenades. Nothing can justify such barbarism. We can think of no punishment too severe for the criminals responsible. We are confident that those who perpetrated this brutal act will be brought to justice. I thank God that this incident is now ended, with the safe deliverance of most of those who had to endure the ordeal inflicted on them-and on all of civilized society. We express our condolences to the families of those killed and pray for the speedy recovery of those injured. We look forward to the safe and speedy reunion of the passengers with their families and loved ones.”</p>
						<p>“He [Reagan] was making statements like, to try to strengthen aviation security and so forth would screw up the aviation industry,” says Joan Deppa, Syracuse University professor and author of The Media and Disasters: Pan Am 103. “And George Bush had been with the CIA, which had not been able to prevent this thing.” Reagan routinely sent Bush, his vice president, to attend mass funerals, but this time, neither leader made an appearance at any of the memorial services.</p>
						<p>For a few weeks, stories ran everyday about the attack and new findings. For many places, it was a local story because a town lost one or two people, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest. As the New Year arrived, the Lockerbie bombing began falling from the headlines. “It didn’t remain a national story the way that when 9/11 happened it was all-consuming,” says Deppa.</p>
						<p>But then the victims’ families came to Syracuse for the memorial service early in the spring of 1989 and started discussing how to increase awareness of the disaster and how it could have been prevented. The families decided to march in front of the White House on the 103rdPan Am 103 had crashed. Only then did George Bush agree to meet with the contingent, where they requested an investigation into how the government handles terrorist warnings. “The families began to really have an active role in calling attention to the tragedy and so forth, but there had been this real dip because the leadership in the country was not acknowledging what an awful thing this was,” Deppa says.</p>
						<p>On the other hand, Pan Am 103 was receiving much more attention in the United Kingdom. In England, Queen Elizabeth changed her recorded Christmas statement to the people to incorporate the Lockerbie bombing, and the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, commented on it several times and announced the central government would fund the investigation.</p>
						<p>The Lockerbie bombers attacked Pan Am because at the time, it was considered the flagship airline carrier for the United States, especially because it was popular with many military and diplomat travelers. “In a sense, we were attacked, but it was not framed that way by the leadership,” says Deppa. “Until Bill Clinton came into office, no president stood with the families.” Clinton was in office during the trial and attended both the groundbreaking and the dedication of the memorial cairn in Arlington Cemetery. This was a collection of stones donated by Lockerbie for a traditional Scottish memorial.</p>
						<p>Although Clinton supported the families lobbied for more airline security, a better warning system, and more competent airport staff, few changes went into effect. “If Congress had taken more note of what Pan Am families were saying and what they were saying about aviation security, 9/11 could have been prevented,” says Deppa.</p>
