			<div class="pop_up" id="coverage_pop_up"><p>Reagan made a brief statement:<br><br>
			"The hijacking of Pan American Airways flight 73 at Pakistan's Karachi International Airport was a cruel and sinister terrorist act. Our hearts are filled with sympathy for the families of those innocents killed and injured. The Government of Pakistan acted boldly and decisively to bring this nightmare to an end, and we applaud Pakistan's exemplary resolve in the handling of this incident. Pan American Airways should also be commended for their cool and professional competence in helping to ensure that this incident could be concluded where it started.<br><br>
			The terrorists conducted a despicable and cowardly crime by threatening, assaulting, and murdering innocent passengers of a crowded airliner—men and women, young and old—with machine guns and hand grenades. Nothing can justify such barbarism. We can think of no punishment too severe for the criminals responsible. We are confident that those who perpetrated this brutal act will be brought to justice. I thank God that this incident is now ended, with the safe deliverance of most of those who had to endure the ordeal inflicted on them-and on all of civilized society. We express our condolences to the families of those killed and pray for the speedy recovery of those injured. We look forward to the safe and speedy reunion of the passengers with their families and loved ones."</div>

			<div class="pop_up" id="deppa_pop_up"><p>"[Reagan] was making statements like, to try to strengthen aviation security and so forth would screw up the aviation industry,” says Joan Deppa, Syracuse University professor and author of The Media and Disasters: Pan Am 103. “And George Bush had been with the CIA, which had not been able to prevent this thing.” Reagan routinely sent Bush, his vice president, to attend mass funerals, but this time, neither leader made an appearance at any of the memorial services.<br><br>For a few weeks, stories ran everyday about the attack and new findings. For many places, it was a local story because a town lost one or two people, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest. As the New Year arrived, the Lockerbie bombing began falling from the headlines. "It didn’t remain a national story the way that when 9/11 happened it was all-consuming," says Deppa.<br><br>
			But then the victims’ families came to Syracuse for the memorial service early in the spring of 1989 and started discussing how to increase awareness of the disaster and how it could have been prevented. The families decided to march in front of the White House on the 103rd Pan Am 103 had crashed. Only then did George Bush agree to meet with the contingent, where they requested an investigation into how the government handles terrorist warnings. “The families began to really have an active role in calling attention to the tragedy and so forth, but there had been this real dip because the leadership in the country was not acknowledging what an awful thing this was,” Deppa says.<br><br>
			On the other hand, Pan Am 103 was receiving much more attention in the United Kingdom. In England, Queen Elizabeth changed her recorded Christmas statement to the people to incorporate the Lockerbie bombing, and the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, commented on it several times and announced the central government would fund the investigation.</div>

			<div class="pop_up" id="airplane_pop_up"><p>The Lockerbie bombers attacked Pan Am because at the time, it was considered the flagship airline carrier for the United States, especially because it was popular with many military and diplomat travelers. “In a sense, we were attacked, but it was not framed that way by the leadership,” says Deppa. “Until Bill Clinton came into office, no president stood with the families.” Clinton was in office during the trial and attended both the groundbreaking and the dedication of the memorial cairn in Arlington Cemetery. This was a collection of stones donated by Lockerbie for a traditional Scottish memorial.<br><br>
			Although Clinton supported the families lobbied for more airline security, a better warning system, and more competent airport staff, few changes went into effect. “If Congress had taken more note of what Pan Am families were saying and what they were saying about aviation security, 9/11 could have been prevented,” says Deppa.</div>



			<div class="card" id="wreckage"><img src="images/wreckage.png"></div>

			<div class="pop_up" id="wreckage_pop_up"><p>Immediately following the explosion of Pan Am 103, the media hurried to the scene in Lockerbie and found a difficult story to cover because the debris was spread over 800 square miles. One reporter would get to one part of the scene and think they knew the whole story, while another reporter would arrive at a different area and publish completely different details. The first few hours of the investigation were extremely complicated as hoards of international media rushed to Lockerbie. The news process was very different from the dissemination of information in today’s Internet age. Much more confusion surrounded the incident, making it a tough time for those connected to Pan Am 103 because they were forced to wait for information.<br><br>The news media also descended on the Syracuse University campus looking for students to interview, including friends of the deceased who were still in shock over the terrible incident. Although many were respectful, there were several reporters who resorted to unethical standards to get the story. For example, one photographer climbed up on a fire escape to shoot photos through the windows of a sorority that had lost three sisters. Others harassed students leaving the services held at Hendrick’s Chapel, asking for interviews and taking pictures of the mourning SU community.<br><br>
			Another reporter called John F. Kennedy International Airport and pretended to be from Syracuse University to secure a list of the names of the victims. The reporter published a list of 38 people who were believed to be from SU. The problem was only 35 Syracuse students perished in the crash. Three were not on board the plane, which immediately created confusion and grief among friends and family.</div>



			<div class="card" id="scream"><img src="images/scream.jpg"></div>

			<div class="pop_up" id="scream_pop_up"><p>Reporters flocked to the JFK airport as well. In one of the most traumatic instances, a woman and her husband arrived to pick up their daughter from her semester abroad. They saw the news truck and media, but had not yet heard the news. Since they were early, the woman approached a Pan Am employee and asked when flight 103 would be arrived. The employee told her that it had crashed, and she collapsed on the floor screaming, “Not my baby! Not my baby!” The television cameras and photographers flocked to her and focused their cameras in on the woman who had just learned she lost her child. Several media outlets ran the footage, and the New York Daily News ran the photo of the woman sprawled on the floor screaming on the front page. They defended the photo choice by saying that since it happened in a public place, it was public. She later spoke out and described the experience as being “visually raped.”<br><br>
			These instances shed light on the problem that there were no professional standards about how to cover grieving people. At the time, the standards were set by the specific news organizations. Editors were screaming at reporters to get interviews and footage of families. Journalism students at SU started asking if they had to behave the way they saw journalists behaving, recounts Deppa. “The other part of the question was: because if we do, we don’t want to be journalists,” she says. The Syracuse University staff set out to find out what happened. Some journalists had refused to bother grieving families, yet no one was fired. The Society of Professional Journalists and news organizations began to develop industry standards for the coverage of tragedies and grieving people. For example, if a person is not in a position to reject media attention at the moment, then you must respect their privacy. After the Pan Am incidents, the media has been much more considerate of people and delicate in these awful situations.<br><br>
			At the 10th anniversary of Pan Am 103, SU prepared for heavy media coverage, linking with Lockerbie, London, Washington and New York. But then another big news event happened that same day. “We were on the news, but we weren’t ‘the’ news,” says Deppa, which reflected the slow media coverage of what was, until September 11th, the largest terrorist attack on Americans.</div>
