					<p>Joan Deppa, Syracuse University associate professor and author of <i>The Media and Disasters: Pan Am 103</i>, suggested that a more concerted effort by government leaders to address airline security in 1989 could have changed U.S. history.</p>

					<p>"Reagan was making statements that trying to strengthen aviation security and so forth would screw up the aviation industry," says Joan Deppa, Syracuse University associate professor and author of <i>The Media and Disasters: Pan Am 103</i>. "And George Bush had been with the CIA, which had not been able to prevent this thing." Reagan routinely sent Bush, his vice president, to attend mass funerals, but this time, neither leader made an appearance at any of the memorial services.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p>For a few weeks following the Pam Am 103 bombing, stories ran every day about the attack and new findings. For many places, it was a local story because a town lost one or two people, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest. By early January, the Lockerbie bombing began falling from the headlines. "It didn't remain a national story the way that when 9/11 happened it was all-consuming," Deppa said.</p>
					<p>But then the victims' families came to Syracuse for the memorial service in the spring 1989 and started discussing how to increase awareness of the disaster and how it could have been prevented. It wasn't until the families decided to march in front of the White House that George Bush finally agreed to a meeting at which the contingent requested an investigation into how the government handles terrorist warnings. "The families began to really have an active role in calling attention to the tragedy and so forth, but there had been this real dip because the leadership in the country was not acknowledging what an awful thing this was," Deppa said.</p>
					<p>In contrast, Pan Am 103 was receiving much more attention in the United Kingdom. In England, Queen Elizabeth changed her recorded Christmas statement to the people to incorporate the Lockerbie bombing, and the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, commented on it several times and announced the central government would fund the investigation.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="sample">
					<p>The Lockerbie bombers attacked Pan Am because it was considered the flagship airline carrier for the United States at that time and was popular with many military and diplomatic travelers. "In a sense, we were attacked, but it was not framed that way by the leadership," Deppa said. "Until Bill Clinton came into office, no president stood with the families." Clinton was in office during the trial and attended both the groundbreaking and the dedication of the memorial cairn in Arlington Cemetery. The cairn was a collection of stones donated by Lockerbie for a traditional Scottish memorial.</p>
					<p>Although Clinton supported the families and lobbied for more airline security, a better warning system and more competent airport staff, few changes went into effect. "If Congress had taken more note of what Pan Am families were saying and what they were saying about aviation security, 9/11 could have been prevented," Deppa said.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="card" id="wreckage">
				<div class="content"><img src="images/wreckage.png"></div>

				<div class="sample">
					<p>Immediately following the explosion of Pan Am 103, the media hurried to the scene in Lockerbie and found a difficult story to cover because the debris was spread over 800 square miles. One reporter would get to one part of the scene and think they knew the whole story, while another reporter would arrive at a different area and publish completely different details. The first few hours of the investigation were extremely complicated as hoards of international media rushed to Scotland. The news process was very different from the dissemination of information in today's Internet age. Much more confusion surrounded the incident, making it a tough time for those connected to Pan Am 103 because they were forced to wait for information.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p>The news media also descended on the Syracuse University campus looking for students to interview, including friends of the deceased who were still in shock over the terrible incident. Some reporters resorted to unethical or disrespectful  tactics to get the story. For example, one photographer climbed up on a fire escape to shoot photos through the windows of a sorority that had lost three sisters. Other reporters harassed students leaving the services held at Hendricks Chapel, asking for interviews and taking pictures of the mourning SU community.</p>
					<p>Another reporter called John F. Kennedy International Airport and pretended to be from Syracuse University to secure a list of the names of the victims. The reporter published a list of 38 people who were believed to be from SU. The problem was only 35 Syracuse students perished in the crash. Three were not on board the plane, which immediately created confusion and grief among friends and family.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="card" id="scream">
				<div class="content"><img src="images/scream.jpg"></div>

				<div class="sample">
					<p>Reporters flocked to the JFK airport as well. In one of the most traumatic instances, a woman and her husband arrived to pick up their daughter from her semester abroad. They saw the news truck and media, but had not yet heard the news. Since they were early, the woman approached a Pan Am employee and asked when Flight 103 would be arriving. The employee told her that it had crashed, and she collapsed on the floor screaming, "Not my baby! Not my baby!" The television cameras and photographers flocked to her and focused their cameras in on the woman who had just learned she lost her child. Several media outlets ran the footage, and the <em>New York Daily News</em> ran the photo of the woman sprawled on the floor screaming on the front page. They defended the photo choice by saying that because it happened in a public place, it was public. She later spoke out and described the experience as being "visually raped."</p>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p>These instances shed light on the problem that there were no professional standards about how to cover grieving people. At the time, the standards were set by the specific news organizations. Editors were screaming at reporters to get interviews and footage of families. Journalism students at Syracuse University started asking if they had to behave the way they saw journalists behaving, Deppa recounted. "The other part of the question was: because if we do, we don't want to be journalists," she said. The SU staff set out to find out what happened. Some journalists had refused to bother grieving families, yet no one was fired. The Society of Professional Journalists and news organizations began to develop industry standards for the coverage of tragedies and grieving people. For example, if a person is not in a position to reject media attention at the moment, then you must respect their privacy. After the Pan Am incidents, the media has been much more considerate of people and delicate in tragic situations.</p>
					<p>At the 10th anniversary of Pan Am 103, SU prepared for heavy media coverage, linking with Lockerbie, London, Washington and New York. But then another big news event happened that same day. "We were on the news, but we weren't 'the' news,"  Deppa said, which reflected the slow media coverage of what was until 9/11 the largest terrorist attack on Americans.</p>
