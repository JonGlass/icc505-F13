					<p>In a poll of 100 people conducted in November 2013 by the authors of this report, 77 percent said that the increased measures in airline security have made them feel safer. Furthermore, in a 2012 Gallup poll, 54 percent of Americans think the TSA is doing an "excellent" or "good" job at handling security in airports. The results of the Gallup poll also indicated that younger Americans have significantly more positive opinions on the TSA. Forbes hypothesized that this might be because younger people fly more, or more importantly, because young people have been experiencing heightened security as a normal procedure since 9/11.</p>

					<p>Pan Am 103 was a milestone in terrorism, but it didn't quite have the impact that 9/11 did. In our poll, we asked, "Has your life changed since 9/11?" Responses tended to mention a sense of anxiety in public places, and  often referred to increased security measures with a sense of annoyance.</p>

					<p>"Laws and regulations (especially pertaining to security measures) are much more strict. Personal freedoms are being infringed upon for the sake of 'national security.'"</p>
					<p>"I am brown and although I am of Latina descent I have been racially profiled. I have many friends who have also been racially profiled. I feel that fear is instilled more on the news than ever before."</p>
					<p>"There is an underlying stress constantly at airports, public spaces, and other places that have intense security."</p>
					<p>"I was young when September 11th happened. I didn't really understand terrorism. It forced us at a young age to understand it and extremely fear it. It made it very real and hit very close to home. We live in constant fear since that day."</p>
					<p>"Since it's such a significant moment in recent history, I notice that when people are looking back on an event or measuring time from that year, they will always mention it somehow. For example, 'I must have been 15 when that happened because I remember it was about 3 months after 9/11.' I also notice that foreigners mention it a lot and associate it with the United States in a significant way."</p>

					<p>The archives at Syracuse University's Bird Library are a treasure trove of information, everything from touching to tragic. During Remembrance Week, Cara Howe, Assistant Archivist specializing in the Pan Am 103/Lockerbie Air Disaster archives, allows visitors to pore over the documents chronicling the disaster itself, the resulting fallout, the media coverage, and some exquisite examples of individual and group cooperation and rehabilitation. Howe encourages those interested to further research the tragedy and its silver linings: the sense of community, the triumph of the spirit, and the resulting groundbreaking movements as the families rallied to change the world and prevent future catastrophes.</p>

					<p>"Syracuse's 2012 Remembrance Scholars, family members of the victims, students, staff, and community members gather to commemorate the lives lost. Even years later, Remembrance Week at Syracuse University is a significant, meaningful and deeply revered tradition. United by tragedy, the week is an amazing indicator of how closely everyone involved has grown.</p>
					<p>"I look at some of these people and I think, 'they couldn't be any closer than brothers and sisters.' And if it wasn't for this one event on one day, they wouldn't even know who they were." -Ed Galvin, director of archives at Syracuse University, which includes the world's most comprehensive archive of Pan Am Flight 103</p>
