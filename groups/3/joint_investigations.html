			<h1>Joint Investigations</h1>
			<div class="note" id="before_pan_am"><p>Text: In 1984 and 1986, Congress passed laws allowing the US to investigate terrorist activities overseas. Along with this type of authority came the need for joint investigations between countries. There have been hundreds of terrorist attacks across the world, but very few of them are actually state sponsored. – Richard Marquise.</p></div>

			<div class="caption" id="map_caption">There were 19 countries involved because there were victims from 19 different countries on the plane.</div>
			<div class="pop_up" id="map_pop_up">Just because the majority of passengers on the plane were from the US did not mean that the US got to be in charge of the investigation. Pan Am 103 was the first multinational investigation and the FBI’s largest investigation ever. The “main players” in the investigation were the US, Scotland, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Malta, and England. Police from both Italy and France had minor involvement as well. Because the plane landed in Lockerbie, a small police department, Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary, was in charge despite all of the much larger top-agencies from around the world.</div>
			<div class="card" id="quote">“Everyone likes to be in charge of their own case... Knowledge is power.” ~Richard Marquis, Head of the FBI's investigation</div>
			<div><p>This was the first joint investigations of this sort. There was a long learning process and a lot of building trust that had to take place between the countries.</br>
			“Cooperation from the various law enforcement agencies started slow, but it really ended on a high note. There are still very strong bonds between us and the Scottish Police.” ~Frank Duggan</br>
			“We didn’t really quite grasp the concept of teamwork. It took a while to do that. You had to develop trust. It took a lot of interpersonal skills on the part of everyone on the investigation.” ~Richard Marquise</p></div>
