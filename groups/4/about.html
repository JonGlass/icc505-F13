            <h1>December 21, 1988</h1>
                <p>
                25 years ago, Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 
                people. 35 of the victims were students returning from Syracuse University's study 
                abroad program. Every year, SU comes together during Remembrance Week to 
                remember those young individuals, to keep them in our hearts, and to 
                educate in order to keep tragedies like Pan Am 103 from happening again.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                This year, in conjunction with the Newshouse, Jon Glass and Dan Pacheco's ICC 505 
                class set out to cover the 25th Remembrance Scholars, students selected each year to                    represent those lost 25 years ago. These are among SU's most promising students, just as the victims of Pan Am 
                103 were among the most promising students of their day. They have shown great 
                dedication and consideration for the families of the victims, and through them, we 
                honor the past and look to the future.  Explore our interactive map of the SU campus to learn more about this year's scholars.
