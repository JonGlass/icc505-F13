				<div id="tagline">The story of how Syracuse and Lockerbie became forever entwined by one tragedy</div>

			<div id="text intro">
				<p>It was an act of terror meant to serve as retaliation against the United States for a targeted strike two years prior during Operation El Durado Canyon.  It wasn’t meant to hit anyone in specific, just to build fear and show that Libya wasn’t afraid to fight back against the superpower nations.  But when the bomb went off and Pan Am 103 fell from the sky, it changed the lives of everyday people across the world.  And when the dust settled in Lockerbie, what remained were the people left behind.</p>
				<p>It quickly became apparent that two particular groups of people would forever be changed from that day on.  The attack did not target Syracuse University or Lockerbie, Scotland.  The terrorists held no grudge against a private college tucked into a mid-sized city in the center of New York State, or a sleepy little town sitting among the hills in Southern Scotland.  But even without these intended victims, Syracuse and Lockerbie would never be the same.  Syracuse became a campus filled with reminders of those 35 students who did not make it home for Christmas, and Lockerbie became synonymous with sadness and disaster.</p>
				<p>But somewhere amidst the tragedy and mourning, these two places marred by grief came together to heal.  This is the story of a bond that arose between a college campus and a quiet community, and how that bond has remained for a quarter-century, providing happiness in a subject that is so frequently met by tears and sorrow. </p>

						<p>Lockerbie wore its Christmas colors with pride in 1988 — its Christmas trees up, its lights twinkling against the snow, its cards written and sent. But by Christmas Day, four days after the bombing of Flight Pan Am 103 shook the town, the lights were packed up. The trees were taken down. There was nothing left to celebrate.</p>
						<p>For ten long years, Lockerbie marked the Christmas season with a lone Christmas tree and darkness. But, in 1998, a decade since the tragedy that cast an inescapable shadow over the town’s holiday season, the Light Up Lockerbie public campaign brought lights back to the city center of the small Scottish town.</p>
						<p>Let’s Light Up Lockerbie, aided by a trust fund established since the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 shocked the community, raised more than 19,000 pounds sterling to string lights throughout the city. Lawrence Mason, a multimedia, photography and design professor at Newhouse who spent time chronicling Lockerbie’s history, remarked to the Daily Orange that the reason the lights switched back on in 1998 was because Lockerbie’s citizens wished for their children to celebrate a proper Christmas.</p>
						<p>The town had also fallen into dire need of new lights — Mason says the lights fell ten years deep into disrepair, and during December of 1998, Lockerbie resident Marjory McQueen told the Associated Press, “The media has got a hold of this, that the lights are being switched on again in Lockerbie after 10 years. Well, we never had any.”</p>
