			    <p>From Cliff Jacobs, Child & Family Studies:<br><br>I plan to act forward by being a role model to those who do not have one. Growing up in a community with limited role models, I struggled to get to where I am on my own. Having the ability and privilege to be where I am now, I believe it is necessary to give back. I plan on utilizing my education, views, and beliefs in order to help those less fortunate than me. In doing so, I plan on being an empowered bystander and advocate to better the lives of others.<br><br>From Leo Wong, Advertising:<br><br>I plan on acting forward by living the life that Steven Berrell didn't have the chance to by being a positive influence to those around me, being proactive in embracing all opportunities to grow as an individual, and by creating change by fighting for what I stand for.<br><br>From Erin Carhart, Policy Studies/Women's & Gender Studies:<br><br>Acting forward for me means working immensely hard to empower, educate, and advocate for marginalized communities to seek a more just world. It also means fearlessly loving and enjoying my life and sharing my passion with others.<br><br>From Sieglinder Mghenyi, Public Health:<br><br>I act forward by cheering on all those I meet to fight for what they believe in, pursue their goals and dreams and by finding beauty in the world and sharing it with others.<br><br>From Jamie Yavorsky, Music Education<br><br>I act forward through music; Nicole Boulanger's memory lives in every performance I put on and every lesson plan i write. As a music educator, I act forward by teaching students the tools to mourn, honor, and remember lost loved ones in their own lives the way I have for the 35 students lost in Pan Am 103.</p>
