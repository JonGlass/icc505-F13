						<h2>Tower Bridge</h2>
						<div class="description">
							<p>The bridge, which is not the reference is the popular nursery rhyme "London Bridge is Falling Down," sits on the River Thames and is named so because of its proximity to the Tower of London. It was frequent for the students to take photos with the bridge in the background.</p>

						<h2>Syracuse University in London, 1988</h2>
						<div class="description">
							<p>While the location of the SU campus has changed since 1988, many hallmarks of the old location can still be seen such as students living in locations closer to where the old location used to be. Just to the west of Kensington Gardens in Notting Hill, there is a homely atmosphere all around.</p>
